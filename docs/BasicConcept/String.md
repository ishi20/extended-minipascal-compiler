# String
Unlike string type in standard Pascal, string in Mini-Pascal is not composed of characters. You can not access every single character in the string. However, you can store the string into a variable of string type, and you can concatenate two strings through operator `+`.

To manipulate string variable, you can write a `JFunction` in the variable and do the task in Java Instruction level.

## Syntax
```
